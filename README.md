# Hello there! 👋

I'm Sofia, a frontend developer from Saint Petersburg, Russia, passionate about creating useful applications that make people's lives easier.

I design and build practical web applications with a focus on user comfort and experience. If I see an opportunity to simplify someone's daily routine, I'll build a solution for it.

## Tech Stack & Tools
- **Frontend:** React, JavaScript, TypeScript, HTML/CSS
- **Version Control:** Git, GitHub
- **Design & Collaboration:** Figma, Adobe
- **Development:** VS Code, Visual Studio

I've built around 10 projects so far.

I enjoy both creating projects from scratch and diving into existing codebases. 

-  **Hobbies:** Rock climbing (bouldering), running, reading books
-  **Music taste:** Classic rock, Phil Collins, jazz
-  **Family:** I have a poodle named Tyler who's my coding companion

I'm always open to discussing new projects, creative ideas, or opportunities to be part of your vision.

Feel free to explore my repositories and don't hesitate to reach out if you'd like to collaborate or just chat about development, bouldering, or the best Phil Collins tracks! 

P.S. Tyler says hello too! 🐩
