# Hello there! 👋

I'm Sofia, a frontend developer from Saint Petersburg, Russia, passionate about creating useful applications that make people's lives easier.

I design and build practical web applications with a focus on user comfort and experience. If I see an opportunity to simplify someone's daily routine, I'll build a solution for it.

## Tech Stack & Tools
- **Frontend:** React, JavaScript, TypeScript, HTML/CSS
- **Styling:** Modern CSS, responsive design principles
- **State Management:** React Hooks, Context API
- **Build Tools:** Webpack, Vite
- **Version Control:** Git, GitHub
- **Design & Collaboration:** Figma, Adobe Creative Suite
- **Development:** VS Code, Chrome DevTools, ESLint, Prettier
- **Productivity:** Notion, Trello, Pomodoro technique (of course! ⏱️)

I've built around 10 projects so far, but my favorite is definitely my **Pomodoro Timer** - a productivity application that helps people manage their time effectively using the famous Pomodoro technique.

I enjoy both creating projects from scratch and diving into existing codebases. Complex challenges don't intimidate me – they actually excite and motivate me to find elegant solutions. There's something special about transforming a complex problem into a simple, intuitive interface.

- 🧗‍♀️ **Hobbies:** Rock climbing (bouldering), running, reading books
- 🎵 **Music taste:** Classic rock, Phil Collins, jazz
- 🐩 **Family:** I have a poodle named Tyler who's my coding companion
- 📚 **Current read:** Usually alternating between tech books and fiction
- ☕ **Fun fact:** I practice what I preach – using my own Pomodoro Timer to stay productive!

The intersection of technology and human comfort fascinates me. I believe that well-designed applications shouldn't just solve problems – they should do so in a way that feels natural, intuitive, and even delightful. Every pixel, interaction, and line of code is an opportunity to make someone's day a little better.

I'm always open to discussing new projects, creative ideas, or opportunities to be part of your vision.

Feel free to explore my repositories and don't hesitate to reach out if you'd like to collaborate or just chat about development, bouldering, or the best Phil Collins tracks! 🎶

P.S. Tyler says hello too! 🐩
